# Blockchain Java Implementation

This is a simple Java implementation of a blockchain data structure with supporting classes and JUnit tests. The project consists of three main classes:

1. **Block.java**: This class represents a single block within the blockchain. Each block contains a previous hash, a timestamp, a nonce, and a hash.

2. **Blockchain.java**: This class implements the blockchain itself, where blocks are added and validated. It also contains methods for mining new blocks.

3. **BlockchainTest.java**: This is a JUnit test class that tests the functionality of the `Blockchain` class and its related methods.
